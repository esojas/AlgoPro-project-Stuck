Expected Outcome

# About the game
im creating a 2d platformer where player has 1 bullet to shoot at an object that will dissapear after getting shot. Where it will then drop a block that can be place anywhere by the player. 
The player then can use this block as a stepping stool to get through the level by parkour. Each new level will add the difficulty like enemies that can shoot and etc. 

# What this prototype can do
so far im stuck at a point where I cant get to place the gun and bullet at the position of where the character is standing. My plan after figuring out how to have the gun locate the player position is to have the gun only pop out and can be use after pressing the "s" key where the player cant move anywhere as well.
